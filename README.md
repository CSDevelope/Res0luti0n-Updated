RES0LUTI0N is a malware builder undetected by Windows Defender with an anti-VM coded in python and C#. It uses a triple layer randomized obfuscation system, a malware partitioning system and a recompilation system at the same time.
## Features

- **Undetected by Windows Defender**
- **Python & requirements auto installer**
- **Anti VM**
- **Background injector**
- **Can build an undetectable malware .exe**
- **Use 2 differents exe compiler**
- **You can choice your own malware or use one already included**
- **Three-layer obfuscation**
- **Can inject any python code**
- **Easy to use**
- **Quick use**

## Requirements
- **Windows 10/11** OS only (*win32, for x86, x86_64, and arm64 architectures*)
- **Python 3.x** (*python 3.9 used for the project.*)
- **Modules:** (*colorama, pypresence, pyinstaller, cx_freeze*)

## Usage
### 1. First step

Start by installing the modules by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

*↦Troubleshooting: If an error occurs, check that you are using a version of python equal or lower than 3.9.x as this may cause errors or use `pip pip install --upgrade pip`*

### 2. Second step

Now run the program with python by clicking on it or by using the command :
```console
python Res0luti0n.py
```
*↦Troubleshooting: Check that the modules are installed correctly, that you are using the right operating system and that your python works properly*

### 3. Third step

1) Change the settings by pressing `2` and `enter`:

*↦Troubleshooting: If this does not work, check that you have entered the correct parameters (webhook...)*

### 5. Usage
For the proper functioning of the injector it is imperative that the entirety of what is in the ZIP created is located in the same directory.

*↦Hint: This is only valid if you use cx freeze*
